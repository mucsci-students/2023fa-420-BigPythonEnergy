This script is the view portion of the MVC for the command line interface. It pushes major groups of text or reused text to the controller for output.

- `clearScreen()`: A helper function to clear the CLI screen.
- `entryDisplay()`: Shows the entry text displaying who made the game.
- `mainGameDisplay()`: Shows the display for the main game, giving the puzzle letters, score, and commands.
- `startMenuDisplay()`: Showcases commands for the starting menu.
- `newGameDisplay()`: Gives options to start a game when the start command is given.
- `unrecognizedCommand()`: For when a command is not recognized.
- `helpMenuDisplay()`: Displays the help menu in its entirety.
- `returnGuessing()`: Tells players to press a key to return to guessing after using a command.
- `getWords()`: Prints a list of all found words.

This script acts as the user interface for the Spelling Bee game and coordinates interactions with other modules and game logic.
